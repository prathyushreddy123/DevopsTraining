# First Steps - What is DevOps?
DevOps brings together a combination of software development and operations. DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.
Another important thing to know is that as a DevOps engineer, your job is to make sure that the different teams - the ones who make the software (developers), the ones who run it (operations), and the ones who test it (QA) - work together smoothly without keeping things separate.


Here is the detailed [Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/devops) that can be helpful to find out the tools and technologies for the Devops.

The final point I will make is to make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage **Automation**.

## Responsibilities of a DevOps Engineer
There are two main parts when creating an application. We have the Development part where software developers program the application and test it. Then we have the Operations part where the application is deployed and maintained on a server.

## DevOps is the link between the two
Everything starts with the application! You will see so much throughout that it is all about the application when it comes to DevOps.

Developers will create an application, this can be done with many different technology stacks and let's leave that to the imagination for now as we get into this later. This can also involve many different programming languages, build tools, code repositories etc.

As a DevOps engineer you won't be programming the application but having a good understanding of the concepts of how a developer works and the systems, tools and processes they are using is key to success.

At a very high level, you are going to need to know how the application is configured to talk to all of its required services or data services and then also sprinkle a requirement of how this can or should be tested.

The application will need to be deployed somewhere, let's keep it generally simple here and make this a server. This server needs to run somewhere, on-premises, in a public cloud.  Someone needs to create and configure these servers and get them ready for the application to run. Now, this element might land to you as a DevOps engineer to deploy and configure these servers.

It is also likely that we need to communicate with other services in our network or environment, so we also need to have that level of knowledge around networking and configuring that, this might to some degree also land at the feet of the DevOps engineer. This involves DNS, DHCP, Load Balancing etc.

## Jack of all trades, Master of none
You don't need to be a Network or Infrastructure specialist you need a foundational knowledge of how to get things up and running and talking to each other, much the same as maybe having a foundational knowledge of a programming language but you don't need to be a developer.

## KeyPoints:
Developers creating new features and functionality (as well as bug fixes) for the application.
Devops Engineer setup Infrastructure or servers which are configured and managed to run this application and communicate with all its required services.
Devops Engineer deploys features and bug fixes and make them available to the end users. How do we release the new application version? This is one of the main tasks for a DevOps engineer, and the important thing here is not to just figure out how to do this once but we need to do this continuously and in an automated, efficient way which also needs to include testing!
