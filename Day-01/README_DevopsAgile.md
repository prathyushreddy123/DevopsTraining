# Devops and Agile

In this post, we will examine the crucial differences between Agile and DevOps and find out why the two are connected so tightly.

Let's start with definitions.

## Agile Development
Agile is an approach that focuses on delivering small results faster rather than releasing one big interaction of the product; software is developed in iterations. The team releases a new version every week or month with incremental updates. The final goal of Agile is to deliver an optimal experience to the end-users.

## DevOps
We have been covering this for the past few days with a few different ways of describing the end goals of DevOps. DevOps usually describes software development and delivery practices based on cooperation between software developers and operations specialists. The main DevOps benefits are delivering a simplified development process and minimising miscommunication.

## What is the difference between Agile and DevOps
The difference is mainly the preoccupations. Agile and DevOps have different preoccupations but they are helping each other. Agile wants short iteration, which is only possible with the automation that DevOps brings. Agile wants the customer to try a specific version and quickly give feedback which is only possible if DevOps make the creation of a new environment easily.

Different participants
Agile focuses on optimising communication between **end-users and developers** while DevOps targets **developers and operation** team members. We could say that agile is outward-oriented toward customers whereas DevOps is a set of internal practices.

## Team
Agile usually applies to software developers and project managers. The competencies of DevOps engineers lie in the intersection of development, QA (quality assurance) and operations as they are involved in all stages of the product cycle and are part of the Agile team.

## Applied Frameworks
Agile has a lot of management frameworks to achieve flexibility and transparency: Scrum > Kanban > Lean > Extreme > Crystal > Dynamic > Feature-Driven. 

DevOps focuses on the development approach in collaboration but doesn't offer specific methodologies. However, DevOps promote practices like Infrastructure as Code, Architecture as Code, Monitoring, Self Healing, end to end test automation ... But per se this is not a framework, but rather practice.

## Feedback
In Agile the main source of feedback is the end-user while in DevOps the feedback from stakeholders and the team itself has a higher priority.

## Target areas
Agile focuses more on software development than deployment and maintenance. DevOps focuses on software development as well but its values and tools also cover deployment and post-release stages like monitoring, high availability, security and data protection.


## The Tools Used
Agile tools are focused on management communication collaboration, metrics and feedback processing. The most popular agile tools include **JIRA, Trello, Slack, Zoom, SurveyMonkey** and others.

DevOps uses tools for team communication, software development, deployment and integration like **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, BitBucket, etc**. Even though agile and DevOps have slightly different focuses and scopes the key values are almost identical, therefore you can combine the two.
